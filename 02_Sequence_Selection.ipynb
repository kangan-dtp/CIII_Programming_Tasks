    "#### The three core concepts of programming ####\n",
    "\n",
    "The three basic control structures in programming are sequence, selection, and iteration. These structures allow us to control the flow of a program and make decisions based on certain conditions.\n",
    "- **Sequence**: This is the default mode of execution in programming. Statements are executed one after another in the order they appear in the code.\n",
    "- **Selection**: This structure allows us to make decisions in our code. We can choose to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. The most common selection statements are `if`, `else if`, and `else`.\n",
    "- **Iteration**: This structure allows us to repeat a block of code multiple times. The most common iteration statements are `for` and `while` loops.\n",

    "## Sequence\n",
    "Sequence is the default mode of execution in programming. Statements are executed one after another in the order they appear in the code. For example, consider the following code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a simple sequence of statements\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = 10\n",
    "z = x + y\n",
    "print(\"The sum of x and y is:\", z)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the statements are executed in the order they appear. The first statement prints \"Hello, World!\", then assigns the value 5 to `x`, assigns the value 10 to `y`, calculates the sum of `x` and `y`, and finally prints the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "These statements are executed in sequence, one after the other. The output of this code will be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "The sum of x and y is: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "The sequence above is required to produce the correct output. If we change the order of the statements, we may not get the expected result. For example, if we try to print `z` before calculating it, we will get an error:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This will cause an error\n",
    "print(\"The sum of x and y is:\", z)  # Error: z is not defined\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "y = 10\n",
    "z = x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, we will get an error because `z` is not defined before we try to print it. This shows the importance of sequence in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "*would it matter if the sequence of x=5 and y=10 were swapped?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=\"blue\">Task 1: Sequence</font>\n",
    "For the below code snippets, fix the sequence of statements to produce the correct output.  No changes to the statements are allowed.  You can only change the order of the statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: use the error messages to help you identify the problem.*"

    "Selection allows us to make decisions in our code. We can choose to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. The most common selection statements are `if`, `else if`, and `else`.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the above a street number is entered.  If the number is even, the program will set *direction* to *eastbound*.  Otherwise, it will set *direction* to *westbound*.  The paths diverge and if the user never enters an odd number, the program will never set *direction* to *westbound*.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the selection structure one side of the code is run.  The other side is not.\n",
    "2. The decision to be made needs to be able to be expressed as True or False (Boolean)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example in code looks like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a simple selection statement\n",
    "street_number = int(input(\"Enter your street number: \"))\n",
    "if street_number % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even\n",
    "    direction = \"eastbound\"\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    direction = \"westbound\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(direction)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax and Indentation\n",
    "In the code above, notice the syntax of the `if` statement. The condition is followed by a colon (`:`), and the block of code that should be executed if the condition is true is *indented*. This indentation is important in Python, as it indicates which statements belong to the `if` block.\n",
    "There is then an `else` statement, which is also followed by a colon and an indented block of code. The `else` block will be executed if the condition in the `if` statement is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentaition is a key feature of Python. Code will not run if it is not indented correctly.  The code below will not run:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This code will not run due to incorrect indentation\n",
    "street_number = int(input(\"Enter your street number: \"))\n",
    "if street_number % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even\n",
    "    direction = \"eastbound\"\n",
    "else:\n",
    "direction = \"westbound\"  # This line is not indented correctly\n",
    "print(direction)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will produce an `IndentationError` because the `else` block is not indented correctly. In Python, indentation is used to define the scope of code blocks, and all statements within the same block must be indented at the same level.  Indentation can be done using spaces or tabs, but it is important to be consistent throughout your code.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Comparison Operators\n",
    "Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean result (True or False). The most common comparison operators are:\n",
    "- `==`: Equal to\n",
    "- `!=`: Not equal to\n",
    "- `>`: Greater than\n",
    "- `<`: Less than\n",
    "- `>=`: Greater than or equal to\n",
    "- `<=`: Less than or equal to\n",
    "These operators can be used in selection statements to make decisions based on the values of variables. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a simple selection statement using comparison operators\n",
    "age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "if age >= 18:  # Check if the user is an adult\n",
    "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are a minor.\")\n",

In this case, we are checking if the number is greater than 0 and if it is divisible by 3.  If both conditions are true, the program will execute the block of code inside the `if` statement.\n",
    "The logical operators available in Python are:\n",
