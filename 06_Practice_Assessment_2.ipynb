    "## Scenario: Personal Budget Tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "Youâ€™ve just started a side hustle as a freelance software developer. To keep better track of your earnings and expenses, you decide to create a simple console-based Python application that helps you manage your personal budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "This basic budget tracker should allow the user to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add an income or an expense\n",
    "    - If the transaction is an expense that exceeds the current balance, the program should display a warning message and not allow the transaction to be added.\n",
    "2. View balance\n",
    "3. View a full transaction history\n",
    "4. Exit the program\n",
    "5. Each transaction must include:\n",
    "    - An amount (positive for income, negative for expense)\n",
    "    - A description (e.g., \"Freelance project\", \"Groceries\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon the program's start balance should be set to $1000\n",
    "There should also be three transactions already in the history:\n",
    "- $200.00 for \"Freelance project\"\n",
    "- $50.00 for \"Groceries\"\n",
    "- $20.00 for \"Coffee\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The transactions that are already in the history do not count towards the current balance. The user can add new transactions, and the program will update the balance accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone has already started the code for you. Your task is to complete the code and add the necessary functionality.\n",
    "*The code given to you is incomplete and contains errors. You need to fix the errors and complete the code.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to design and implement this console application using basic Python concepts. You should demonstrate your understanding of:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables and data types\n",
    "Lists or dictionaries\n",
    "Functions\n",
    "Conditional statements (if, elif, else)\n",
