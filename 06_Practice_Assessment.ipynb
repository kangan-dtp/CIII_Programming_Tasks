    "# Grocery Expense Tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "You're starting to manage your grocery spending with a new console-based Python application: Grocery Expense Tracker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features:\n",
    "1. Add a grocery-related income or expense\n",
    "    - If there is an expense that exceeds the current budget, the program should display a warning message and not allow the transaction.\n",
    "2. View the current budget balance\n",
    "3. View the full transaction history\n",
    "4. Exit the program\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "- The budget starts at $500\n",
    "- There are three predefined transactions already in the history:\n",
    "    - -$200.00 â€” \"Weekly groceries\"\n",
    "    - -$45.00 â€” \"Bought snacks and drinks\"\n",
    "    - +$15.00 â€” \"Cashback - Grocery app\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These initial transactions do not affect the current balance. Only transactions entered during the session impact it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone has already made a start on the code, but it needs to be completed. The code is partially implemented and contains some errors. Your task is to fix the errors and complete the implementation.\n",
