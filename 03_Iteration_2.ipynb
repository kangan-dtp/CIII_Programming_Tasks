    "Let's look at an example in Python. We will use a nested loop to print 1 to 10 five times.  First, we create an outer loop that will iterate 5 times.  For each iteration of the outer loop, we create an inner loop that will iterate 10 times.  The result is that we print the numbers 1 to 10 five times.\n",
